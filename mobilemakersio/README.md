# TutorialsSite
Posts for the tutorial section are broken up between the includes and the root directory. Currently, main landing pages are located in the root directory (TutorialsSite/mobilemakersio/), and posts are located in the posts/ directory just for the sake of organization.

# Adding new tutorials
Run the postGenerator script and give it the name of the tutorial (without spaces in the name). This will generate an empty skeleton file in the posts section with the name you provided. After you create the post, navigate to the includes/ folder and append it into the sidebar in the navbar.php file.
